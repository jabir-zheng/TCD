## A Solemn Statement Regarding the Plagiarism Allegations.

We regret to hear about the serious accusations from the CTM team.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We sadly found out our CTM paper (ICLR24) was plagiarized by TCD! It&#39;s unbelievableüò¢‚Äîthey not only stole our idea of trajectory consistency but also comitted &quot;verbatim plagiarism,&quot; literally copying our proofs word for word! Please help me spread this. <a href="https://t.co/aR6pRjhj5X">pic.twitter.com/aR6pRjhj5X</a></p>&mdash; Dongjun Kim (@gimdong58085414) <a href="https://twitter.com/gimdong58085414/status/1772350285270188069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2024</a></blockquote>

Before this post, we already have several rounds of communication with CTM's authors. 
We shall proceed to elucidate the situation here.

1. In the [first arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19159v1), we have provided citations and discussion in A. Related Works:
    > Kim et al. (2023) proposes a universal framework for CMs and DMs. The core design is similar to ours, with the main differences being that we focus on reducing error in CMs, subtly leverage the semi-linear structure of the PF ODE for parameterization, and avoid the need for adversarial training. 

2. In the [first arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19159v1), we have indicated in D.3 Proof of Theorem 4.2
    > In this section, our derivation mainly borrows the proof from (Kim et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022).
    
    and we have never intended to claim credits.
    
    As we have mentioned in our email, we would like to extend a formal apology to the CTM authors for the clearly inadequate level of referencing in our paper. We will provide more credits in the revised manuscript.

3. In the updated [second arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19159v2), we have expanded our discussion to elucidate the relationship with the CTM framework. Additionally, we have removed some proofs that were previously included for completeness.

4. CTM and TCD are different from motivation, method to experiments. TCD is founded on the principles of the Latent Consistency Model (LCM), aimed to design an effective consistency function by utilizing the **exponential integrators**.
  
5. The experimental results also cannot be obtained from any type of CTM algorithm.
   
   5.1 Here we provide a simple method to check: use our sampler here to sample the checkpoint [CTM released](https://github.com/sony/ctm), or vice versa.
   
   5.2 [CTM](https://github.com/sony/ctm) also provided training script. We welcome anyone to reproduce the experiments on SDXL or LDM based on CTM algorithm.

We believe the assertion of plagiarism is not only severe but also detrimental to the academic integrity of the involved parties. 
We earnestly hope that everyone involved gains a more comprehensive understanding of this matter.

## Introduction

TCD, inspired by [Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469), is a novel distillation technology that enables the distillation of knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models into a few-step sampler. In this repository, we release the inference code and our model named TCD-SDXL, which is distilled from [SDXL Base 1.0](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0). We provide the LoRA checkpoint in this üî•[repository](https://huggingface.co/h1t/TCD-SDXL-LoRA).

![](./assets/teaser.jpeg)

‚≠ê TCD has following advantages:

- `Flexible NFEs`: For TCD, the NFEs can be varied at will (compared with [SDXL Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo)), without adversely affecting the quality of the results (compared with [LCM](https://github.com/luosiallen/latent-consistency-model)), where LCM experiences a notable decline in quality at high NFEs. 
- `Better than Teacher`: TCD maintains superior generative quality at high NFEs, even exceeding the performance of DPM-Solver++(2S) with origin SDXL. It is worth noting that there is no additional discriminator or LPIPS supervision included during training.
- `Freely Change the Detailing`: During inference, the level of detail in the image can be simply modified by adjusing one hyper-parameter gamma. This option does not require the introduction of any additional parameters.
![](./assets/tcd_diff_gamma.png)
- `Versatility`: Integrated with LoRA technology, TCD can be directly applied to various models (including the custom Community Models, styled LoRA, ControlNet, IP-Adapter) that share the same backbone, as demonstrated in the [Usage](#usage-anchor).
![](./assets/versatility.png)
- `Avoiding Mode Collapse`: TCD achieves few-step generation without the need for adversarial training, thus circumventing mode collapse caused by the GAN objective. 
In contrast to the concurrent work [SDXL-Lightning](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning), which relies on Adversarial Diffusion Distillation, TCD can synthesize results that are more realistic and slightly more diverse, without the presence of "Janus" artifacts.

## Usage
To run the model yourself, you can leverage the üß® Diffusers library.
```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate peft
```
And then we clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jabir-zheng/TCD.git
cd TCD
```
Here, we demonstrate the applicability of our TCD LoRA to various models, including [SDXL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0), [SDXL Inpainting](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1), a community model named [Animagine XL](https://huggingface.co/cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.0), a styled LoRA [Papercut](https://huggingface.co/TheLastBen/Papercut_SDXL), pretrained [Depth Controlnet](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-depth-sdxl-1.0), [Canny Controlnet](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0) and [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter) to accelerate image generation with high quality in few steps.
